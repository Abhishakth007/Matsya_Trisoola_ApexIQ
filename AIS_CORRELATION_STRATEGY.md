# AIS Correlation Strategy: Production-Grade Vessel Detection Matching

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive strategy for correlating SAR vessel detections with AIS data, specifically designed to handle the challenging edge case of **20-30 minute temporal gaps** between AIS data collection and SAR image acquisition. After analyzing multiple algorithmic approaches, we recommend a **hybrid production-ready algorithm** that combines robust motion modeling with multi-cue likelihood scoring.

## Problem Statement

### Core Challenge
- **SAR Image**: Captured at unknown timestamp (estimated 5-7 minute window)
- **AIS Data**: Available for **unknown duration** before image capture
- **Goal**: Match each detection to an AIS track (MMSI) with absolute precision
- **Edge Case**: Handle **ANY temporal gap** (minutes to hours) where vessels may have maneuvered significantly

### Available Data
- **Detections**: 4 vessels with full attributes (position, size, speed, heading, type)
- **AIS**: 75,360 records with comprehensive vessel information
- **Temporal Gap**: **Unknown duration** between last AIS and SAR capture (could be minutes to hours)

## Algorithm Analysis & Selection

### Solution A: Production-Ready Algorithm ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Why This is Optimal for Our Use Case:**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
1. **Handles Large Temporal Gaps**: Explicitly models unknown image time (Œît) as latent variable
2. **Production-Grade**: Vectorized, efficient, handles real-world noise
3. **Multi-Cue Validation**: Uses position, heading, size, speed, and vessel type
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence scores and match quality metrics
5. **Scalable**: O(n log n) complexity with KD-tree spatial gating

#### üéØ **Perfect for Our Edge Case:**
- **ANY Œît ‚Üí Adaptive Process Noise**: Motion uncertainty scales with ANY time gap
- **Multi-Time Approach**: Tests multiple Œît values to find optimal match
- **Robust Gating**: Spatial gates widen appropriately for ANY temporal gap
- **Non-Positional Cues**: Heading, size, and type help when position is uncertain
- **Unknown Gap Handling**: No assumptions about temporal gap duration

#### üìä **Performance Characteristics:**
- **Speed**: ~1-5 seconds for 1000 AIS tracks √ó 200 detections √ó 40 Œît samples
- **Memory**: Efficient with vectorized operations
- **Accuracy**: High precision with multi-cue validation

---

### Solution B: Advanced Probabilistic Methods

**Analysis:**
- **EM Joint Estimation**: Excellent for Œît + association optimization
- **Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter**: Best posterior uncertainty quantification
- **MHT Multi-Frame**: Ideal for multiple SAR passes

**Verdict**: **Overkill for our current needs** - adds complexity without proportional benefit for single-image correlation.

---

### Solution C: Research-Grade Approaches

**Analysis:**
- **Cross-Modal ReID**: Requires training data we don't have
- **Learned Embeddings**: Needs labeled SAR-AIS pairs
- **Deep Learning**: Overkill for our 4-detection scenario

**Verdict**: **Future enhancement** - valuable for large-scale deployment but not needed now.

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Production Algorithm

### Phase 1: AIS Preprocessing & Motion Modeling

```python
# Per-MMSI Track Building
for each MMSI:
    # 1. Clean duplicate messages
    # 2. Build timestamped track (lat, lon, COG, SOG)
    # 3. Fit motion model (Constant Velocity/Constant Turn Rate)
    # 4. Compute last state x_j,0 and covariance P_j,0
    # 5. Set class-dependent process noise Q(Œît)
```

**Motion Models by Vessel Type:**
- **Cargo/Tanker**: Low process noise (œÉ_v ‚âà 0.25 m/s)
- **Fishing Vessel**: High process noise (œÉ_v ‚âà 1-3 m/s)
- **Small Craft**: Very high process noise (œÉ_v ‚âà 2-5 m/s)

### Phase 2: Detection Error Modeling

```python
# Build detection covariance Œ£_Di
detection_covariance = {
    'geo_error': SAR_georeferencing_uncertainty,
    'bbox_uncertainty': bbox_size_based_uncertainty,
    'heading_uncertainty': heading_bucket_uncertainty,
    'timestamp_uncertainty': image_time_uncertainty
}
```

### Phase 3: Temporal Gap Handling

**Strategy: Adaptive Grid Search Over Œît**
```python
# Test multiple time gaps - ADAPTIVE RANGE
# Start with coarse search, then refine around best candidates
Œît_candidates_coarse = np.arange(0, 7200, 300)  # 0-2 hours, 5min steps
Œît_candidates_fine = np.arange(0, 7200, 60)     # 0-2 hours, 1min steps
Œît_candidates_precise = np.arange(0, 7200, 30)  # 0-2 hours, 30s steps

# Adaptive search strategy
best_Œît = None
best_global_likelihood = -inf

# Phase 1: Coarse search to find promising regions
for Œît in Œît_candidates_coarse:
    likelihood = compute_global_likelihood(Œît)
    if likelihood > best_global_likelihood:
        best_global_likelihood = likelihood
        best_Œît = Œît

# Phase 2: Fine search around best candidates
promising_regions = find_promising_regions(Œît_candidates_coarse)
for region in promising_regions:
    for Œît in np.arange(region-300, region+300, 60):
        likelihood = compute_global_likelihood(Œît)
        if likelihood > best_global_likelihood:
            best_global_likelihood = likelihood
            best_Œît = Œît
```

### Phase 4: Multi-Cue Cost Computation

**Cost Components:**
1. **Position Mahalanobis Distance**: `d¬≤_ij = (z_i - xÃÇ_j)·µÄ(S_ij)‚Åª¬π(z_i - xÃÇ_j)`
2. **Heading Likelihood**: Compare detection heading vs AIS COG
3. **Size Validation**: Compare vessel dimensions
4. **Speed Feasibility**: Check speed consistency
5. **Type Compatibility**: Fishing vs cargo vessel matching

**Combined Cost:**
```python
C_ij = w_p * (1/2 * d¬≤_ij) + w_Œ∏ * L_heading + w_s * L_size + w_v * L_speed + w_t * L_type
```

### Phase 5: Association & Matching

**Algorithm: Hungarian Algorithm with Dummy Columns**
```python
# Build cost matrix
cost_matrix = compute_all_costs(detections, ais_tracks, Œît)

# Add dummy columns for "no-AIS" matches
cost_matrix = add_dummy_columns(cost_matrix, dark_ship_penalty)

# Solve assignment problem
matches = hungarian_algorithm(cost_matrix)
```

## Edge Case Handling: ANY Temporal Gap

### Challenge Analysis
- **Unknown Temporal Gap**: Could be minutes to hours - no assumptions
- **Vessel Movement**: Vessels can travel 2-50+ km depending on gap duration
- **Maneuver Uncertainty**: Course changes, speed changes, stops, port calls
- **Process Noise Growth**: Position uncertainty increases quadratically with time

### Our Solution
1. **Adaptive Process Noise**: Q(Œît) = Q‚ÇÄ + Q‚ÇÅ * Œît + Q‚ÇÇ * Œît¬≤ (scales with ANY gap)
2. **Multi-Time Search**: Test Œît from 0 to 2+ hours (adaptive range)
3. **Wide Spatial Gates**: r = f(‚àötrace(P_j) + detection_error) (scales with uncertainty)
4. **Non-Positional Cues**: Heavy weighting on heading, size, type (when position uncertain)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Flag low-confidence matches (especially for large gaps)
6. **Adaptive Search**: Coarse ‚Üí Fine ‚Üí Precise search strategy

### Validation Strategy
```python
# For each match, compute confidence score
confidence = {
    'position_score': mahalanobis_distance,
    'heading_score': heading_compatibility,
    'size_score': dimension_match,
    'speed_score': speed_feasibility,
    'type_score': vessel_type_match,
    'temporal_score': time_gap_penalty
}

# Flag matches below threshold
if confidence < 0.7:
    flag_as_uncertain()
```
